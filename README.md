# React Portfolio

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-green)

In this project, I used my knowledge of React to build a portfolio that I can present to employers for my upcoming job search. It has four sections:

* About Me
* Completed Projects 
* Contact
* Resume

I used the component, props and states functionality provided by React to add some dynamism to the portfolio and enjoyed the process of making this site.
