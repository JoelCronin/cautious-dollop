            <p>Originally from London, UK I moved to Toronto in March 2022. Having spent seven successful years as a Mechanical and Electrical Engineer with London Underground, I'm now broadening my skill set to focus on web development. </p><br></br>
            <p>To kick start this process, I enrolled with the University of Toronto's School of Continuous Studies Coding & Web Development course. In this rigorous and fast-paced course I learnt all the fundamentals of full stack web development (check out the Resume section for a full list) and now I am eager to implement these new found skills in the workplace. </p><br></br>
            <p> Head over to the portfolio tab for a selection of the individual and group projects that demonstrate these skills!</p> <br></br>
